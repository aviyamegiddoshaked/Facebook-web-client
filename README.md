- **React**: Provides reusable components and efficient state management.
- **HTML & CSS**: Structures and styles the interface for a clean and mobile-friendly design.

### Backend:
The server-side is designed to handle requests, manage data storage, and provide efficient communication with the frontend. Key technologies include:

- **Node.js**: Non-blocking, event-driven architecture for high-performance server handling.
- **Express.js**: Simplifies server creation and routing, ideal for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: Flexible NoSQL database for storing user data and application content.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Implements secure user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens.
- **WebSockets**: Enables real-time communication for instant updates between client and server.
- **Multithreading**: Supports concurrent request handling for better performance.
- **TCP**: Ensures reliable and ordered data communication between systems.
- **RESTful API**: Structures communication between the frontend and backend using REST principles.
